# Hi There!

This project was made with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). But I imagine you guessed that already.

## What is this?

This is the second version of my portfolio website. I made it as a single page application (SPA) with client side routing. Yes, sounds very fancy doesn't it. This really just means all the files are downloaded by your computer at once and when you click a link on the page you're not downloading new files, just moving between ones you already have. SPA's make navigating around a webpage MUCH faster. I really do hope you enjoy the new site.
